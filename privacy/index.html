This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information. By using the White Noise mobile application (“App”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to ensure stable app operation and improve user experience.</p>

  <h3>2.1. Automatically Collected Data</h3>

    <li>App performance and crash data;</li>
    <li>Advertising and analytics identifiers (IDFA, GAID, etc.);</li>
    <li>Country and time zone (approximate, non-precise).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>All this data is anonymized and not linked to personally identifiable information.</em></p>

  <h3>2.2. Subscription and Payment Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are processed exclusively by Apple through the App Store.</li>
    <li>We do not receive or store your payment card or Apple ID details.</li>
    <li>We may receive anonymous transaction data (e.g., successful subscription or renewal) to unlock premium features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3. No Sensitive Data</h3>
  <p>We do not collect user-generated content, photos, contacts, microphone, camera, or precise location data.</p>

    <li>Analyze aggregate usage patterns and improve user experience;</li>
    <li>Manage premium subscriptions and access control;</li>
    <li>Measure marketing campaign effectiveness and user retention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is processed using secure, industry-standard methods (SSL/TLS, encryption in transit and at rest).</li>
    <li>We do not host personal data on our own servers — all data is processed by verified third-party providers listed below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following trusted services for analytics, monetization, and marketing attribution:</p>
